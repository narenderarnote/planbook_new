      <p class="feedback">I just had to drop you another email and say how much I LOVE planbook.com. This is by far the BEST investment in planning I have ever made in my teaching career. It is so easy to use, save plans (and trees!), and manipulate my schedule and lesson plans. I cannot thank you enough for this wonderful product! <br />
        <em><strong>Angela</strong>, 2nd Grade Teacher, Pennsylvania</em></p>
      <p class="feedback">Our school (and now most of our district) uses planbook and we absolutely love it! I plan with a group of teachers and planbook makes it so much easier because only one person has to write out the plans and everyone else imports which gives us more time to create awesome lessons! I really love the updates you have made recently; it's great to see that you are continually working to improve and seek feedback from teachers. Planbook, you guys rock! <br />

        <em><strong>Crystal</strong>, 5th Grade Teacher, North Carolina</em></p>
      <p class="feedback">I just wanted to tell you that I was so excited to find out you have the option for a cycle schedule!  Although my school has changed to a M-F schedule this year, I have a feeling we'll be going back to our 6-day cycle next year, and I was concerned I wouldn't be able to use my beloved Planbook! I love that I can access this from home or school too. Makes planning sooooo much easier. So, Yay Planbook! And thanks! <br />

        <em><strong>Alisa</strong>, 1st Grade Teacher, Indiana</em></p>
      <p class="feedback">I just wanted to tell you I am IN LOVE with this app. I have been teaching for 18 years and I have always used an old fashioned block plan book to plot out each week... Which involves writing in schedule every week... What a time saver this is!!!!  12 dollars a year is what a nice plan book costs anyway, plus I can't lose it!!! Great job. Very easy to figure out, lots of useful features (sharing, events etc.) Thanks geniuses! :) <br />

      <p class="feedback">Your planbook tool is amazing. It organizes everything and makes my plans and materials available from any computer access. I have used it for one week and just renewed for three years. I did a free month trial with your tool as well as a competitor, and there is no comparison. In planbook, I can see all 3 of my high school classes at once without creating separate books and the color coding makes it simple and attractive. A quick email to your support helped me to understand how to embed planbook on my teacher webpage. I was amazed that I could modify the student view and I could use separate url links so students will only see their specific class. You made including Common Core standards easy, so I can show my administrator which standards I have covered in a lesson. Thanks for a great tool and quick customer support! <br />
